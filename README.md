playwright_automation_project

This project is a Playwright-based automation framework designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing of web applications. It includes support for TypeScript, ESLint, Fixtures, Page Object Model (POM), and CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions.

Features TypeScript Support: Write tests with type safety and modern JavaScript features.

ESLint Integration: Enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.

Fixtures: Reusable test logic and setup/teardown steps.

Page Object Model (POM): Encapsulate page-specific logic for maintainable tests.

CI/CD Integration: Automate testing with GitHub Actions.

Cross-Browser Testing: Run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Getting Started Prerequisites Node.js: Ensure Node.js (v18 or higher) is installed. Playwright: Install Playwright and its dependencies.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-playwright-project.git
cd my-playwright-project

Install dependencies:
npm install

Install Playwright browsers:
npx playwright install

Run All Tests
npm run test

Run Tests in Chrome
npm run test:chrome

Run Tests in Debug Mode
npm run test:debug

Generate and View HTML Report
npm run test:report

Run ESLint
npm run lint

Fix ESLint Issues
npm run lint:fix
CI/CD Integration The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to automate:

Linting: Run ESLint on every push or pull request.

Testing: Run Playwright tests on multiple browsers.

Artifacts: Upload test results and HTML reports.

Page Object Model (POM) The project uses the Page Object Model to encapsulate page-specific logic. Each page (e.g., login-page.ts) extends a BasePage class for common functionality.

Fixtures Custom fixtures are defined in src/fixtures/ to reuse test logic and setup/teardown steps.

Acknowledgements Playwright for the powerful automation framework. TypeScript for type safety. ESLint for code quality.

Any browser • Any platform • One API
Cross-browser. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.

Cross-platform. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed.

Cross-language. Use the Playwright API in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, .NET, Java.

Test Mobile Web. Native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari. The same rendering engine works on your Desktop and in the Cloud.

Resilient • No flaky tests
Auto-wait. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - the primary cause of flaky tests.

Web-first assertions. Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.

Tracing. Configure test retry strategy, capture execution trace, videos, screenshots to eliminate flakes.

No trade-offs • No limits
Browsers run web content belonging to different origins in different processes. Playwright is aligned with the modern browsers architecture and runs tests out-of-process. This makes Playwright free of the typical in-process test runner limitations.

Multiple everything. Test scenarios that span multiple tabs, multiple origins and multiple users. Create scenarios with different contexts for different users and run them against your server, all in one test.

Trusted events. Hover elements, interact with dynamic controls, produce trusted events. Playwright uses real browser input pipeline indistinguishable from the real user.

Test frames, pierce Shadow DOM. Playwright selectors pierce shadow DOM and allow entering frames seamlessly.

Full isolation • Fast execution
Browser contexts. Playwright creates a browser context for each test. Browser context is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context only takes a handful of milliseconds.

Log in once. Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests.

Powerful Tooling
Codegen. Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language.

Playwright inspector. Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points, explore execution logs.

Trace Viewer. Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source, and many more.
